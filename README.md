## üëÄ Product Vision Document

### ‚òùÔ∏è Proposal

**What problem does your app solve?**
- If you are a customer, the app helps you find food trucks you might be interested in based on distance. If you are an owner, it allows customers to find your truck. In general, it allows buyers and sellers to find each other more efficiently.

**Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?**
- The app performs a search based on distance and departure times, so users and owners can always tell who is in close proximity to which truck.

**What is the mission statement?**
- FoodTruck TrackR was designed to make finding and eating at a food truck fast, easy and fun. Quickly see all of our Operator partners' nearby food trucks that currently open, view their current real-time GPS location, know the scheduled arrival and departure times, view photos, read customer reviews and much more, all in our easy to use app. Try FoodTruck TrackR today, and enjoy the best food your city has to offer.
